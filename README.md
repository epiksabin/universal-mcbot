# universal-mcbot
a minecraft tool to annoy players and servers **educational purposes**
THIS IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL CODE, ITS SOMETHING I MADE IN SPARE TIME

## how2run
- install nodejs (if you have it then skip this step)
- download the files
- open command prompt and cd into the installed folder
  - alternatively you can type `cmd` into the path thingy above at the file explorer
- run this in cmd to install dependenices `npm install`
- run `bot.js` via `node bot.js` also in cmd
  - to bypass authme registration per ip, create a `proxies.txt` and input your proxies in format of `socks5://127.0.0.1:9050` - `http://proxy.example.com:8080` - `socks4://proxy.host:1080`
- discord webhook is optional

## features (for now)
- auto login/registration
- coordinate goal
- discord webhook
- custom messages
- custom bot amount and stuff
- proxies

## to be added
- rampage mode (attack everything) [done]
- hostile mode (attack players) [done]
- griefing (self explanatory) [done but highly unstable, not reccomended for now]
- body guard mode (protect players)
- clearing cache prompt after each season

## problems:
bot friendly fire
